The fast food industry thrives as a vibrant sector renowned for its swift eateries offering affordable, convenient, and immediately consumable meals.

While lauded for its convenience and speed, it remains a substantial presence in the global culinary scene, continuously adapting to shifting consumer preferences and embracing advancements in food technology. 

The team's job is to create a face recognition system related to food. They'll be identifying well-known figures who enjoy various fast foods and regular folks who also indulge in fast food

Shown below are the codes used by the group for this Face Recognition task:
# 👉 IMPORTING IMAGES AND INSTALLING FACE RECOGNITION
# 👉 ENCODING PROFILES USING KNOWN FACE IMAGES
# 👉 RUNNING OF FACE RECOGNITION ON KNOWN FAST FOOD CONSUMER

 📌Facial recognition works by using machine learning libraries like OpenCV to create models that can identify faces. This usually starts with gathering a set of labeled images 
   featuring faces and preparing these images to ensure they have a consistent structure and highlight facial features. By utilizing this, the group can recognize known and unknown faces 
   of people consuming fast food.
